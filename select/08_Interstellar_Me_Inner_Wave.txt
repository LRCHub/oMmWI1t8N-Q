I know how you feel inside
Believe me it's alright
The feeling's right on time
Your energy's alive
So stop and look inside
The feeling's right on time
So right
In Sync
You run
Can't hide
Begin, describe
This feeling inside yeah
Which you call me
I know how you feel inside
Believe me it's alright
Will you shine tonight?
Your heart is made of gold
Girl you know I'm sold
