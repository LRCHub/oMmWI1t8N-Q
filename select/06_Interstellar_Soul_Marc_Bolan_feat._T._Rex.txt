Running around in the dawn, with that hat
I can see, I'm no match for you
Doin' the foxtrot on your knees
Garbo Girl
It's so hard to contemplate you

'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul

That rich ditch won't catch me
Girl but it sculpted you
Silk and diamond gilded gauntlet
Can be weird
But I'm scared to look like you

'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul

Speedhead painted toe queen
Girl that's right, if that's your scene
But when the sunlight streams the streets
All your friends look like horror film things

'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul

Lean on my head kiss my knee
Breathe again
Bumble bee in my ear
I see a tear but its solid gold
I don't want to get like you

'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul

So full of interstellar soul
(Repeat to end)
